hey! I'm jose. thanks for checking out my little corner on the internet. 

I'd like to think of myself as a developer and designer in my free time. some of my hobbies include plants ðŸŒ±, mechanical keyboards, and watching movies. 

In this new weblog, I'll be talking about just about anything that interests me - things like movies, art, games, tech (especially indie), and whatever else catches my fancy. 

thanks for visiting! :-)
